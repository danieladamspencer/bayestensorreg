This is an R package that can be used to carry out the analyses using the models in my dissertation. 
I have plans to expand the plotting and post-hoc analysis functionality, but I will have to squeeze the changes into the meager time that I currently have.

# Currently Working
- Joint Bayesian Estimation of Voxel Activation and Interregional Connectivity in fMRI Experiments (Bayesian Tensor Response Regression with a Gaussian Graphical Model)
- Bayesian Tensor Regression with the Tucker Decomposition
- Bayesian Tensor Response Regression with the PARAFAC/CP Decomposition

# Currently Not Working
- The `BTRR_GGM_vignette.Rmd` vignette file will currently run on my computer, but fails to pass R CMD CHECK
